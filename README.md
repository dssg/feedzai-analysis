# Application Grounded Evaluation of Explainable ML methods 

This repository contains the code for the analyses we conducted for the paper titled "On the Importance of Application-Grounded Experimental Design for Evaluating Explainable ML Methods". It includes the performance metric calculations, error propagation, statistical tests, and cross validation across parameter ranges.
